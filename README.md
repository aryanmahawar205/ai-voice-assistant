# AI Voice Assistant

The AI Voice Assistant is a sophisticated voice recognition and response system built to understand and process natural language commands. Leveraging advanced **natural language processing (NLP)** and **machine learning** techniques, it enables intelligent, context-aware interactions with users. The assistant can perform various tasks such as answering questions, controlling smart devices, setting reminders, and more, all through voice commands.

This project integrates voice recognition APIs with machine learning models to deliver seamless and responsive voice-based assistance. It is designed to be scalable, customizable, and adaptable to a wide range of applications, including smart homes, personal assistants, and customer support systems.
